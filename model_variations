MNIST: LeNet
training settings:

CIFAR-10: DDNet-VGG11?, ResNet-18
training settings:

Validate that n_proj = 1 could achieve most of the gain. Some analysis of the rate of the implementation with different n_proj.
Reproduce Figure 2

Implement White noise, PGD, CW and evaluate its impact
Reproduce Figure 3

Implement Adversarial Effects Through Randomization and evaluate its impact on CIFAR10 and MNIST
Reproduce Figure S3 & Figure S4

Effect of lambda_JR
